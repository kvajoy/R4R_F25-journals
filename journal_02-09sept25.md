### Rose

During the data management work session, I realized that something applicable to my research is the importance of staying organized with my data. Creating a data dictionary would be especially useful to ensure that anyone can understand the dataset (even me, if I return to it late), so I can clearly comprehend what I previously did.

### Thorn

Something I did not completely understand is metadata, maybe because I have not been exposed to it before.

### Bud

I could apply my knowledge about licenses to my work, as well as ensure that I never edit the original data.
