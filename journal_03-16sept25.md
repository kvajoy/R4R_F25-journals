## Rose, Bud, Thorn

### Rose

I think that once I learn how to enter commands in the terminal and understand what they are for, I could use the HPC to run my model for analyzing large datasets regarding pesticides. 

### Thorn

I am still struggling to understand the difference between coding in the terminal and coding in Python or Rstudio.

### Bud

I could also use HPC to run image-based models (histology slides) in my current research.

## Research Application

> [!IMPORTANT]

We talked about commands in science, why we use the terminal, IDs, Bash, and HPCs. For my work, I think I might use HPCs and Bash at some point when analyzing very large datasets on contaminants along the US-Mexico border over the years. I do not think I will use them all the time, though, because with smaller datasets I can still do the analysis in Python or R. Specially Python that has so many libraries to do a lot of things.
I also learned about VSCode, which I had not used before, but I would like to start integrating it into my work.

## Cohort meetup discussion

I was planning to attend the cohort meetup, but I got really sick, so I couldnâ€™t go.
