### Rose
I think that once I learn how to enter commands in the terminal and understand what they are for, I could use the HPC to run my model for analyzing large datasets regarding pesticides. 

### Thorn

I am still struggling to understand the difference between coding in the terminal and coding in Python or Rstudio.

### Bud

I could also use HPC to run image-based models (histology slides) in my current research.
