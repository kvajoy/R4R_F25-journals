### Rose

We covered the different environments that can be used for coding. I’ve used Anaconda before, during my undergraduate program, and I think it’s a good tool if you code in different languages. These coding environments can be useful for my work when analyzing data and wanting to share the code.

### Thorn

I’m still a bit confused and kind of afraid of coding in the terminal, it feels harder to me than coding in Python or R. That’s why I don’t think I’ll use Bash, but I will use other open-source scripting languages,and I might use Conda.

### Bud

A good idea might be to share my code with my lab members when I work in a coding environment, because sometimes we end up doing the same things but with different approaches. Particularly for the analysis of metal(loid) concentrations in sediments or organisms and afterwards a risk assessment. 

## Research Application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Monday 13th, 11pm**

For a risk assessment, I actually plan to provide my code, just share my repository and hopefully my lab group memebers will be able to generate their own risk assessments based on that (In fact I’m doing it because a colleague from the lab already asked me for the code, but if I share it the way it is now, without a README.md, it’ll be really hard for her to understand and replicate it).
