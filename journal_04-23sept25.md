### Rose

With LLMs, I can find errors in my code for different purposes in my research. Especially when analyzing the data, there might be bugs on the code that the human eye could take a while to catch.

### Thorn

I think I could find information in different LLMs to achieve a better or more accurate outcome, of course, using human judgment at the end. For example, if I need information from a paper, I could ask an LLM to provide sources from which I could obtain that information and then verify that it can be used.

### Bud

I think I would definitely use LLMs at some point in my work, even for doubts. Not only that, but as a way of learning about different topics, instead of reading super long papers, I could use NotebookLM to listen to that information, which, for me, is more fun than reading (I will eventually read them, but I could listen to the audio overviews first).
