### Rose
With LLMs, I can find errors in my code for different purposes in my research. Especially when analyzing the data, there might be bugs on the code that the human eye could take a while to catch.


### Thorn

I think I could find information in different LLMs to achieve a better or more accurate outcome, of course, using human judgment at the end. For example, if I need information from a paper, I could ask an LLM to provide sources from which I could obtain that information and then verify that it can be used.

### Bud

I think I would definitely use LLMs at some point in my work, even for doubts. Not only that, but as a way of learning about different topics, instead of reading super long papers, I could use NotebookLM to listen to that information, which, for me, is more fun than reading (I will eventually read them, but I could listen to the audio overviews first).

## Research Application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Monday 29th, 11pm**

LLMs are useful for my work, and I believe they are valuable for every researcher nowadays. I have come across many tools that can make tasks easier and the research process more bearable. I plan to use Claude, ResearchRabbit, Gemini, and ChatGPT more often to collect papers and to help answer questions that come up along the way.

## Cohort meetup discussion

> [!IMPORTANT]

> **Due Thursday 2nd, 11am**

During the cohort session, we talked mostly about AI. The main question was whether professors (assuming we were the professors) should promote or ban its use for the new generations. Personally, I believe we should make use of the tools available and take advantage of their benefits. We cannot remain clustered in the past. However, I also think we should first teach students to think critically, so they can use AI effectively without losing their human capacity for dissemination.
