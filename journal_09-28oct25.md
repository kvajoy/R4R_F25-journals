In our last meetup, we talked about copyrights and AI. It was really interesting and full of useful information, especially about regulations in the US. Once you publish through a university like UA, the author automatically owns the copyright, no need to add anything extra. I don’t think I’ll be using this right now, but maybe in the future if I develop something using AI.
