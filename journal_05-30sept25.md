### Rose

 GitHub is very useful for my work. I plan to take code from repositories and possibly contribute to a repository.
 Also, use LLMs to answer any inquiry related to it. 
 
### Thorn

I do not fully understand how to use GitHub yet. For me, it is not very user-friendly, and you can only learn to use it through hands-on experience and a trial-and-error process.

### Bud

I could employ pretrained models for histology images, or even contribute my own code to the GitHub community for health risk assessments.
 

## Research Application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Monday 6th, 11pm**

I will use GitHub for coding purposes in my project. I don’t think I’ll use Git since it seems more complicated than GitHub.

## Cohort meetup discussion

> [!IMPORTANT]

> **Due Thursday 9th, 11am**
>
During the meetup we talked about publishing a paper, we went over how expensive it can be to pay the fees for open-access journals (a couple thousand dollars). I discovered that when you publish a paper, sometimes they actually require your code (which is why it’s so important to stay organized on that!). We also talked about how some big AI software that currently have a “premium” package might eventually become free for everyone, which I thought was really interesting. It was fun, and I got valuable info that I didn’t know before.
