### Rose

 GitHub is very useful for my work. I plan to take code from repositories and possibly contribute to a repository.
 Also, use LLMs to answer any inquiry related to it. 
 
### Thorn

I do not fully understand how to use GitHub yet. For me, it is not very user-friendly, and you can only learn to use it through hands-on experience and a trial-and-error process.

### Bud

I could employ pretrained models for histology images, or even contribute my own code to the GitHub community for health risk assessments.
