### Rose

So far in the FOSS session, we have learned about Open Science, including journals, the pillars of Open Science, and how Open Source allows us to build on others’ work to strengthen our own research.

### Thorn

Overall, I understood everything in general terms. However, I do think GitHub does not have a friendly interface if you are not used to it.

### Bud

Personally, for my work, I think I could definitely employ shared research computer code, potentially from GitHub, for analyzing large pesticide datasets. Most interestingly, I think I could use code to analyze histological slides based on a pretrained model.

## Research Application

Regarding Open Science, I find it very helpful to have access to reports (even though it has its constraints). For one part of my project, I don’t think I will be able to use open data, since I will probably be working with sensitive human data and possibly tribal data, which might not be accessible. However, I do think I will be using open software like R and Python, along with GitHub.
