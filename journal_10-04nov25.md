### Rose

I think this is going to be very useful when trying to use Claude desktop. It’s definitely a tool I hadn’t thought of before, so I’m not sure how I’ll be able to implement it. But I think generating certain graphics with my datasets could be one possible application and helping me with vibe coding. 

### Thorn

Starting with the API key might be hard for me, but I think once I do it, I’ll get used to it.

### Bud

I could use the model to help me with my projects in general, but I need to be careful about examining what it creates. For instance, it could help me with code and with a README file.

## Research Application

> **Due Monday 3rd, 11pm**

For me, Jeff’s presentation made a lot of sense. I might use some of the websites he mentioned. It was very insightful, especially since I’m doing my minor in GIS. I was particularly interested in learning how we can implement open science and computational tools to improve our GIS work. I’ll be using GIS in my project to show pesticide contamination along the border over the past few years.
