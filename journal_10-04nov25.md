For me, Jeff’s presentation made a lot of sense. I might use some of the websites he mentioned. It was very insightful, especially since I’m doing my minor in GIS. I was particularly interested in learning how we can implement open science and computational tools to improve our GIS work. I’ll be using GIS in my project to show pesticide contamination along the border over the past few years.
