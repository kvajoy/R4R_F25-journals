## Research Application

Last week we covered containers. I don’t think I’ll use them often, but if I ever do, it would probably be for a project where I’m responsible for a specific part and then hand it off to someone else to continue. For instance, I might write the code for training a model to analyze tissue images (histology), and then a colleague’s lab could upload the images and use the results for further research.
