### Rose

Currently HPC are not required to my research, so I don't consider I will be using them any time soon.

### Thorn

Definitely the coding on the HPC terminal, it might take me some time to get used to it.

### Bud

If I gather large datasets on pesticide use in Arizona and conduct research that requires HPC and containers, I might use it to work in collaboration with my labmates. 

## Research Application

Last week we covered containers. I don’t think I’ll use them often, but if I ever do, it would probably be for a project where I’m responsible for a specific part and then hand it off to someone else to continue. For instance, I might write the code for training a model to analyze tissue images (histology), and then a colleague’s lab could upload the images and use the results for further research.

## Cohort meetup discussion

> **Due Thursday 30th, 11am**

In the cohort discussion, we covered a bunch of topics. Most of the conversation focused on how things differ between countries and how it might be a bit of a challenge for each of us, as international students, to apply what we’ve learned in this fellowship once we return home. We all shared the regulations in our own countries, and it’s clear that it can be a little tough at first. The US definitely offers more accessibility in that sense. Overall, it was a really good talk.
